start with the main branch, create a new branch. before implmentation, start with a design doc to describe your plan, use an appendonly progress         
  rerport to track your progress. After you finish the implementation, add unit tests, if there are any test errors fix them then repeat. then run         
  local tests and fix any errors repeatedly. then fix clippy and fmt before creating a *draft* PR. then monitor the CI and fix any CI issues               
  repeatedly. you can find Linux source code at /workspace/linux and Rust OS code in /workspace/asterinas I will step away. If you have any questions, ask them now. after it passes the CI, launch 3 agents to review this PR from different angles and let them discuss to reach a conclusion. Then implement all recomendations, then update the PR, monitor the CI, till it's passed. after all of this, write what you did in a doc. all docs should be stored in docs/, don't commit them. feature branch uses name wdcui/<feature>, target branch is main.
